I'm back at development after a nice Christmas/New Years vacation, and this year starts with a gutting and rework of the user interface. Mainly replacing the command line with a more conventional mouse based interface.

I had high hopes for the command line, but it just proved too [clunky, slow and error prone](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/7jxz0q/feedback_friday_30_the_thirty_one_lieutenants_of/). So far, it's still a work in progress. The combat interface is mostly done, but I haven't started on the battle preparation interface yet. I hope to have a playable release out next week.
