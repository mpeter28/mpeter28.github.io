Coding heavy week, but mostly for non visible features. I ported over the previously ad-hoc coded user interface screens to a more traditional Model-View-Controller architecture. It's made for nicer, better tested code, and with the refactor it was easy to add a shared 'help' feature to all the user interface screens.

![Help Command]({{ "/img/t31losb/20171028/help-command.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-fluid rounded"}

![Roster Help]({{ "/img/t31losb/20171028/roster-help.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-fluid rounded"}

![Combat Help]({{ "/img/t31losb/20171028/combat-help.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-fluid rounded"}
