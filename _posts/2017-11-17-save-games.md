This week I added the ability to save the game, which was probably the last major feature needed to make this truly playable.

![Resume Save Game]({{ "/img/t31losb/20171117/resume-game.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-fluid rounded"}

Currently, one can only save while in between lieutenant fights.
