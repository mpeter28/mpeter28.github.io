*Haft Schroedinger Chess* is a [chess variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_variants) with rules inspired by quantum mechanics. The concept was given to me by my friend David Haft (thatotherdavidguy@gmail.com). I in turn formalized the rule set and coded a proof of concept implementation as an exercise in recreational math.

This is not the first quantum mechanics inspired chess variant, nor the first to try and use the name 'Schroedinger Chess'. However, 'Haft Schroedinger Chess', like traditional chess, is a combinatorial game, meaning it is both deterministic (no random chance at all) and has no hidden information. This differs from hidden information chess variants like Kevin Dittmar's [Schroedinger's Chess](https://github.com/dittma75/schrodingers_chess) and non-deterministic variants like Chris Cantwell's [Quantum Chess](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/507726696/quantum-chess).

This project is effectively finished; the blog 'posts' are more articles outlining the game rules, discussing interesting consequences of those rules, and an explanation of the associated Github project.
