The new interfce work continues; I've knocked out the new 'battle preperation' user interface!

![Equip Item]({{ "/img/t31losb/20180125/equip-item.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-fluid rounded"} 

![Unequip Item]({{ "/img/t31losb/20180125/unequip-item.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-fluid rounded"}

![New Scene Card]({{ "/img/t31losb/20180125/new-scene-card.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-fluid rounded"}

I didn't quite reach my goal of pushing a playable release this week however. I need to finish the new 'solution review' interface used by tactics mode, and there's some extra polish I'd like to do as well.
