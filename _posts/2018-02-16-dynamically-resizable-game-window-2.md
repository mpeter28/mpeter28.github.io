The [dynamic sizing](t31losb/2018/02/08/dynamically-resizable-game-window.html) overhaul is finished! Now players can resize the screen freely, with the font size and widget layout adjusting themselves responsively.

The title screen, but smooshed narrow:

![Narrow]({{ "/img/t31losb/20180216/narrow.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-fluid rounded"}

The battle screen, but resized into a square:

![Square]({{ "/img/t31losb/20180216/square.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-fluid rounded"}
